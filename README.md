# stream-scrape
Spotify has always hidden streaming numbers in their API in place for a popularity matrix.
This uses the Spotify web API and web scraping to pull the number of streams for a given track.

The script runs in a VENV, and requires Playwright.

Please replace the client_secret and client_ID with your own, you can get them by creating an app on the Spotify developer dashboard.

Happy Scraping :)
